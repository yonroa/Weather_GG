# WEATHER APP

This is a weather app in which you can search for the weather of a city and get the state of the weather, current temperature, pressure, humidity, speed wind and time.

This application was made using react, redux toolkit and typescript.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## How to Use?

- First go to your terminal and clone the repository `https://github.com/yonroa/Weather_GG.git`.

- Now go inside with `cd Weather_GG` and execute `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

- Then you should set your own api key. From `https://home.openweathermap.org` create an account and copy your api key, then paste it in the `.env` file where says `'Your_Api_Key'` and save.

- Finally execute the application with `npm start`, go to [http://localhost:3000]`(http://localhost:3000)` in your web browser and search for a city in the search bar.
